# 1. '255 seconds' -- Since they can add the first two numbers together in 1 second and then one more from the list of 254 to the cumulative total

# 2. 'Yes. 34 seconds' -- Split the bags evenly between the 8 employees for 32 bags per employee, which they can add up in 31 seconds in parallel.  Then 3 seconds to merge them (8->4, 4->2, 2->1)

# 3. '8 seconds.' --  2 ^ n = 256 -> n = 8 seconds

# 4. Plot Infinite Employees v. 1 Employee
