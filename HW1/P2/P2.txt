P2a_hist.png shows a wide spread of times in the runtime of different partitions.  This is bad becaues it means some partitions will finish fast, while others will still be running.  Therefore you have wasted cycles on the partitions that are done and waiting (at least when you run this on a cluster with multiple cores).  Not only, is it a wide spread of times, most of the partitions run relatively fast compared to the others, and then there is a long tail of just a few partitions that take a long time to finish (these would be the areas in the center that are all white).  That means that just a few pixels are holding up the whole calculation :/

P2b_hist.png has a much smaller spread of times.  Also, the shape of the graph is much prettier, with a nice bell-curve shape.  Most of the tasks fall in the middle of the range, with just a few falling outside.  I tried partitioning based on columns, rows and combination of the two, but randomly assigning the tasks appeared to work best at spreading out the pixels that take the longest to compute amongst all of the partitions.
